# This is the first assignment for keio2018pyalgdatself. Because this is your
# first time implementing code in Python independently, I will guide you by
# providing templates in this source code file. This file provides a general
# outline of your program. You will implement the details of various pieces of
# Python code grouped in functions. Those functions are called within the main
# function, at the end of this source file. Please refer to the lecture slides
# for the background behind this assignment. You will implement something I
# refer to as the linguistic megascope. Given an input file consisting of plain
# English corpus of literature, your task is to analyze this data in order to
# derive syntactic and semantic structure relating linguistic units on the level
# of words. The task progresses gradually, from simple token statistics, to more
# interesting features of language. The last section is a bit more
# computationally involved, so I decided to make it optional. Completing the
# extra credit section can give you extra points that can subsidize your final
# grade in the course, so I recommend doing it. However, not being able to
# complete it won't hurt your final grade in the course. The goal of this
# assignment is to obtain a form of pre-deep-learning vector space embedding
# of words. This embedding maps the words of the language to points in a
# high-dimensional real vector space. We can think of this process as converting
# the linguistic structure of the corpus into a noisy point cloud from a
# neighborhood of what I call a linguistic manifold. The shape of that manifold
# is dictated by the grammar of the language used in the corpus. By embedding
# aligned corpora from different languages (e.g. English and French), we can
# compare the differences in topologies of their corresponding manifolds to gain
# insights into linguistic phenomena. Because the ambient embedding space is a
# real vector space, it comes with a metric. This means we an measure distance
# between vectors corresponding to various words, and use it to cluster them
# into syntactic or semantic categories. If you take my course on Artificial
# Intelligence, you will see different embedding methods that can be applied on
# varying levels of granularity, ranging from letters to entire documents, as
# well as different forms of data. Such vector space embeddings allow for
# linguistically meaningful linear algebra operations, and there likely exist
# interesting subspaces of those manifolds corresponding to various grammatical
# properties of languages. I have also included some visualization tools that
# I wrote in JavaScript, which you can use to explore your results. Don't worry
# if you don't understand the specifics of the visualization code, or some of
# the mathematics involved (especially in the extra credit section). I will
# explain how to use them during lecture. Each function has instructions inside
# its docstring. To view them from a Python interpreter type
# help(name_of_function). For instance, help(w_i). You will submit a single zip
# file with everything the exercises ask you to save to the hard drive, as well
# as your completed assignment.py, part1.py, part2.py, part3.py, part4.py,
# and part5.py source code files. This is the right time to start asking TA
# questions, and involve in discussions on Slack or Piaza with your classmates.
# Good luck!
