    # 1. Load the list of 100 most frequent words from Part I.
    # 2. Load the context dictionary using the load_pkl function.
    # 3. Create a text file called top_100_sim.txt, with 100 lines, each line
    #    corresponding to a word on the same line in the top_100_list.txt file.
    #    The top_100_sim.txt file should contain a series of 100 floating point
    #    numbers in each line (10000 numbers total). The numbers should be your
    #    computed similarities to each of the words in the top_100_list.txt, in
    #    the same order. This means the diagonal numbers should all be 1.0, and
    #    a number in row i, column j should represent similarity of the ith and
    #    jth word in the top_100_list.txt loaded in step 1. You need to use your
    #    implementation of the similarity function to compute those numbers.
    # 4. Answer the question: What kind of matrix would you obtain if you
    #    computed similarity on an empty corpus (with non-empty word list), or
    #    on a non-empty corpus with words that don't appear in it? There is a
    #    name for this kind of matrix. Write it down.
